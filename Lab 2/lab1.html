            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                In Ottawa District, fairly open treed fens, open sedge fens and some swamps associated with
                these fens. Within treed habitats, the orchid plants group in well-defined areas where the
                canopy is thin and shrub layer is absent. In sedge fens the plants are scattered across the
                open fen, on the wet peat of the fen floor or on mounds of fen mosses.
                In Bruce Peninsula, prefers cold northern forests and shaded bogs and swamps.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Flowering Season: June to early July.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 15 cm.
                Leaf solitary, clasping stem near base, dull yellow-green, ovate-elliptic.
                Raceme loose, irregular, somewhat one-sided, with 1-8 flowers, bracts lanceolate.
                Flowers white to pale pink blotted and spotted with deep purple. Petals form hood with
                dorsal sepal. Lip deeply 3-lobed, middle lobe spatulate to cuneate, lateral lobes smaller,
                elliptic.
                Column short, beneath the hood. Spur slender, curved.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Common in the northwest of the continent, widespread but local in the east. Only two
                locations in the Bruce Peninsula, rare and apparently approaching extinction in the Ottawa
                District, loose groups of flowering and non-flowering groups in Eastern Ontario.
                Highly variable pattern of lip colouration in the species.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                Deciduous Forest Region. Rare in both provinces. At the northernmost edge of its
                distribution
                area in southern Ontario and Quebec. Prefers rich deciduous forests, especially beech and
                sugar maple. Prefers deep pockets of humus on the edge of a hole created by uprooting of an
                old tree,.. Often grows in flat, moist areas not far above the level of temporary ponds.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>June.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 20 cm.
                One basal, elliptic leaf stalk, dark green with white veins. Leaf turns dark brown in the
                spring.
                Loose raceme of 5-10 flowers.
                Flowers purplish tipped with brown, 3-lobed lip, central lobe wide, white, marked with
                purple.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Easiest to spot in leaf in the autumn or early spring when the solitary green leaves are
                more
                conspicuous in contrast to the dead leaves on the forest floor. The green overwintering leaf
                takes advantage of the higher light levels available before the trees leaf out to generate
                food stores for energy for flowering and fruiting. Only produces a few flower spikes per
                colony in any season, but produces a new corm each year.
                Both English names refer to the corms. Their sticky consistency was used for mending broken
                crockery by early settlers.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                Arethusa bulbosa is a native of cool sphagnous bogs, usually found at the edges rather than
                the wettest parts of these bogs. It is frequently found along side rose pogonia and
                grass-pink but not seen as frequently as it flowers earlier and is susceptible to late
                frosts.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Flowers can appear in early June in the South through mid-July in the North.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Up to 35 cm. tall with a single grass-like leaf which continues to develop after the flower
                has reached its peak. The solitary flower is magenta with yellow and white but can vary to
                as light as white in colour. The petals are erect at the base but the apex is arched forward
                over the lip. The lip is curved down, wavy on the margin mostly whitish with purple blotches
                and with a brush of whitish hairs on the floor.
                While Arethusa is sometimes compared to Calypso, these early bloomers do not share the same
                habitat: Calypso prefers shaded cedar swamps, but Arethusa prefers sunny, open sphagnum
                bogs.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Arethusa is named for a river nymph of classical Greek mythology. It is also interesting to
                note that nearly all orchid writers seem to wax poetic when describing this beautiful
                flower.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                The Ottawa district is the northern part of the distribution of this orchid. It is a species
                of Deciduous, Mixed and Southeastern Coastal Plain Forest Regions and adjacent edges of
                Boreal Forest. It is normally in unshaded sites such as fens, soggy marl flats, or lush mats
                of sphagnum moss.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Mid June to August.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height: 10-35 cm.
                Leaves basal, 1-2, linear and grass-like.
                Raceme lax, flowers 3-8, rarely 12.
                Flowers large, pink, rose-purple, or magenta-crimson, rarely white; opening successively.
                Dorsal sepal narrowly oblong, acute; lateral sepals ovate, oblique; lateral petals with a
                short claw, ovate-lanceolate or oblong elliptic, often tightly constricted. Lip uppermost
                with 2 lateral lobes and a prominent triangular middle lobe. Central portion of lip is
                densely bearded with short cream hairs with orange knobs. Fragrance rose-like or
                lacking.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Unlike most other orchids, there is no twist in the ovary, so the lip is uppermost in the
                flower. The lip is also unusually hinged at the base so that it bends forward when a bee
                settles upon it; thus, the insect is thrown down on its back against the column and becomes
                smeared with a sticky substance from the stigma. As the bee crawls out, the terminally
                located pollinia become attached to its sticky dorsal surface. When the bee alights on
                another Calopogon, the pollinia are transferred to the stigma of that flower.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                In the east, often located in inaccessible, damp forests. In the Ottawa District, the plants
                grow in calcareous cedar swamps, in partially open places in moist needle-mould on mounds
                around trees or on the swamp floor.
                In the heat of summer all living traces of the plant disappear. In the fall, a single leaf
                is produced, persisting under winter snows until spring blooming.
                This orchid is most common in the west, occurring at moderately high elevations in the Rocky
                Mountains, often in relatively dry pine forests, where it is far more successful in
                reproducing itself
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>May-June-July.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 20 cm depending on habitat.
                Leaf: solitary, basal, dark to bluish-green, appears in autumn.
                Flower showy, solitary, sepals and petals laterally spreading, pinkish-purple, rarely
                whitish. Lip saccate, white, with yellowish 2-pronged apex, streaked with reddish-brown
                inside. Apron formed from edges of lip, covers lower part of sac, white with pinkish-purple
                edges and spots, crested with three rows of golden hairs.

            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Originally documented in an extensive wooded wetland which is now part of the drained and
                cultivated Holland Marsh, this orchid now seems to be extinct in what was the southern
                extreme of its range. Despite its extensive range, this orchid does not survive close
                contact with man: this once well-established orchid has been reduced to a small number of
                remote colonies. The white-flowered f. candida has been reported in Bruce County, Manitoulin
                Island, and Thunder Bay area. Var. occidentalis (Holzinger) Calder &amp; Taylor is presently
                debated as a species, subspecies, variety, or form. It is more similar to the typical
                variety found in Eurasia than to ar. Americana.
                Its habitat is the Pacific Northwest from California to British Columbia. The plant is
                similar to the typical variety, but the lamina of the lip is mottled or irregularly blotched
                with purple, and the tuft of bristles is reduced to a few thin whitish hairs. Isolated in
                the Cascade Mountains and adjacent territory west of the Rocky Mountains in Canada, this
                variety probably relies on different pollinators, as evidenced by the lack of yellow
                bristles to attract bees.

                Dimly lit virgin coniferous forests in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest, from British
                Columbia to California. A relatively primitive genus, and the only truly saprophytic orchid,
                requiring on a symbiotic relationship with a subterranean mycorrhizal fungus for nutrients.
                Fourteen other species inhabit Europe, North Africa, and the northern parts of Asia.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>June to August.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Roots thickened and fibrous, from a short rhizome.
                Height to 65 cm. Stem white, glabrous, leafless, clothed in white sheaths up to 10 cm. long,
                passing into bracts above.
                Raceme loose, up to 20 white flowers.
                Flower sepals and petals do not spread widely, inner half of constricted lip is not readily
                visible, curving up either side of the column; anther sparkling-white, ovary twisted; outer
                segment of lip is broad, heart-shaped but blunt, bears a yellow centre with several low,
                papillose crests.
                To the touch, the plant feels clammy, wax-like.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                The only totally saprophytic species. Capsule is as white as the flower. The plant reminds
                one of the white Indian pipe (Monotropa uniflora).

            <p>
                A circumboreal species, growing in Deciduous and further north Boreal Forest, in rich loam
                over dolostone bedrock, even though it requires acid or subacid soil. Plants generally grow
                in partial shade of forest clearings and edges or among widely spaced trees. The leaf
                covered soil is generally well-drained and often rocky, with sparse ground cover in forests,
                and a mixture of forest and old-field species in clearings and along trails.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Mid May through June, in the far north even to mid-August.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height 10 - 40 cm.
                Stem leafy, all leaves clasping the stem; upper leaves reduced in size.
                Leaves 2 - 5, usually 4; 2 on non-flowering plants.
                Spike 6 - 20 cm long, 5 - 35 flowers, dense or lax.
                Lowermost flower bracts 3 - 5 times larger than flowers, upper bracts much reduced.
                Flowers green, petals and sepals forming a hood over the pendant lip which is toothed,
                sometimes tinged with rose or red-brown. Short, sac-like spur.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Grows alone or in small groups. Occurs infrequently and does not seem to survive for many
                seasons. Widespread from the Carolinian Zone to the shore of James Bay and HudsonÕs Bay.

                A transcontinental species of the Montane, southern Boreal, Mixed and northern Deciduous
                Forest regions. Inhabits dryish sites in rich woodlands. Deciduous tree communities are most
                commonly Beech, Sugar Maple-Beech, and Sugar Maple-Red Oak. Eastern Hemlock is the most
                commontype of coniferous forest, and a preferred site within deciduous forests. Some
                colonies are observed on forested slopes at the edges of peatlands , swamps, and ponds.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Early June to early August.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height 10-50 cm; stem smooth, leafless, madder-purple, brownish or yellowish with several
                tubular sheaths on the lower part. Raceme loose, few to many flowered.
                Flowers similar in colour to the upper part of the stem but a darker shade.
                Lip white usually spotted magenta-crimson or madder, three-lobed with terminal lobe broadly
                rounded and deflexed.
                As all colours of the flowering spike are quite variable, a variety of forms have been
                named:
                1) forma flavida (Peck) Cockerell - With an orange-yellow stem and sheaths, lemon-yellow
                flowers and an unspotted white lip.
                2) forma intermedia Farwell - A predominantly brown plant with the stem and fruits light
                greyish-brown and the sheaths dark purplish-brown.
                3) forma punicea H. H. Bartlet - A plant without a trace of brown, but with the stem and
                fruit lavender or purple and the sheaths much paler than the stem.
                4) forma maculata with a pinkish-purple stem.
                5) an unnamed purple form which flowers earlier than the other forms
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Forma flavida is very rare and only known to exist from the central part of the Bruce
                Peninsula northwards. The stalk of Corallorhiza maculata appears above ground level only
                when flowering and producing seeds.

                Height to 50 cm; stem leafless, reddish to purplish.
                Raceme loose with many flowers; petals in contact with dorsal sepal; lip purplish, margins
                toothed, often lobed near the base, curved sharply downward from near the base.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Special features: a reddish-purple striped lip and a long upward-extending column.
                Some authorities consider this orchid to be only a variety of Corallorhiza maculata, but on
                the basis of plant structure studies it appears to be a separate species.
                Along the shores of Buttle Lake on Vancouver Island, there are large colonies of both
                species, intermingling in a number of places. There are several clumps of what appear to be
                albinos; and a number of other, probably hybrid, plants.

            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 20 cm; leafless.
                Raceme loose with a moderate number of flowers.
                Flowers small and with little spreading, purplish, white lip spotted with magenta or purple
                , curved, finely toothed along the margin.
                A dull yellowish or greenish form with unspotted white lip (f. flavida `Wherry) has been
                found in Kent and Lambton Counties (R. Brown pers. com.) And in Norfolk County (CAN,

            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                A small flower which scarcely opens. Sepals and petals in a claw-like form converge over the
                lip. At flowering time, the ovaries are large and swollen and dominate the bloom. It is
                probable that a mechanism of self-pollination is involved. Once locally common in 30 - 50
                year old pine plantations near St Williams in Norfolk County : in 1951 a stand of several
                thousand (Landon, 1960). The orchids have been all but wiped out by encroaching poison ivy
                where tree thinning occurred.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                Dry to moist clear floors in coniferous and deciduous forests and in a variety of other
                situations. Absent from the Carolinian Zone but widespread and rather local elsewhere in
                Ontario to 50 L. Perhaps most frequent on the Bruce Peninsula and on Manitoulin Island,
                where it is found in dry cedar woodlands where limestone is near the surface. In the Ottawa
                area it grows in partial sun among widely-spaced clumps of Eastern White Cedar on the
                limestone plains of the southwest and under the deeper shade of Balsam Fir and Eastern
                Hemlock on the Canadian Shield to the north. It is also found in dappled to deep shade in
                mixed forests of Eastern White Pine, Balsam Fir, Sugar Maple, Beech, and Eastern White
                Cedar. Under a covering of leaf and/or needle humus, the substrate is usually sand,
                occasionally clay. A few colonies have been encountered growing among the mosses or in the
                wet organic soil of Eastern White Cedar-Balsam Fir swamps.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Mid-June to early July. This is the first of the Corallorhiza to bloom.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 45 cm; stem erect, stout, succulent and leafless, madder-purple to brownish-purple
                with 3-4 slightly inflated sheaths at the base paler than the stem.
                Raceme a loose group of drooping flowers.
                Flowers pinkish-yellow or white, tinged and conspicuously striped with reddish purple, large
                for genus; petals form a loose hood with the dorsal sepal; lip tongue-shaped, pendant,
                somewhat reflexed, fleshy, not lobed, 3 stripes at base merging at apex. Bilobed callus near
                middle of base.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                One of our most striking plants. The distinctive red striping of the flower provides
                immediate identification. The flowers are dime-sized and have translucent sparkle. It is
                primarily a western species, where a common companion plant is Corallorhiza maculata.

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                A transcontinental species of the Boreal and Mixed Forest Regions and adjacent regions of
                the
                Montane and Deciduous Forests and Tundra. Occurring in moist woods, swamps, bogs, along
                wooded streams and in wet meadows, responding well to "cold bottom" conditions. Is frequent
                in swamps dominated by Eastern White Cedar, accompanied by Black Spruce, White Spruce,
                Tamarack, Black Ash and Yellow Birch. Prefers moist habitats in the south, but is frequent
                in drier upland situations northward. Dense, dryish Eastern White Cedar thickets sometimes
                shelter this orchid. Here the substrates are usually sands and sandy loams.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Mid-May to early June in the south to July in the north.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height to 20 cm; stem smooth, leafless, green or greenish-yellow with pale tubular sheaths
                at
                base.
                Raceme a loose group of 3-20 flowers.
                Flowers small, mostly pale greenish-yellow, sometimes tinged with red-brown; petals in
                contact with dorsal sepal to form a hood; lip arcuate-recurved, 3-lobed , lateral lobes like
                small triangular upturned teeth near the narrowed base; lip white, in the typical variety:
                column, upper and lower surfaces of lip with deep magenta or ruby spots.
                In var. verna, the whole plant except the lip is lacking the red and brown colouration; the
                lip is white without spots; odour is faint and acrid, or richly floral, or lacking. Verna is
                the variant generally found in mesic forest habitats
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Plant is widespread, abundant and easily located in a variety of wooded situations. Tends to
                form large clumps and extensive colonies. It is the only member of this genus with
                distinctively yellowish-green colouring in the stem and flowers. Later in the season, the
                orchid remains recognizable because it develops fat yellowish drooping seed pods.

            <p>
                Found in a variety of shaded, acidic habitats, both wet and dry, in boreal and temperate
                regions. For example, in the Bruce Peninsula area, it grows mostly in acid conifer-dominated
                swamps or wooded bogs. It can also be found growing in dry sandy or rocky places if the soil
                requirements are right, particularly under Jack Pines in the northern part of the Bruce
                Peninsula. Also located in White Pine stands along Lake Erie.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Mid to end of May until early July.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height 10 - 59cm. Short, underground stem from which two or, rarely, three dark green,
                strongly veined basal leaves rise, sheathing the scape.
                Leaves and 12-40 cm scape are hairy. One lanceolate, green bract arches over solitary
                flower.
                Flower: sepals and lateral petals yellow-green to purplish-brown with lateral petals
                spreading, somewhat twisted. Lip forming a pouch, showy pink (rarely white) with red or
                purplish veining. Lip opens to an elongate fissure on upper surface. Fragrance usually
                pleasantly floral, varying in intensity from quite strong to none, sometimes with sharp
                notes.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Requires very definite environmental conditions, rarely surviving transplanting to gardens.
                Root system extends approximately a meter in opposite directions from the plant, and cannot
                withstand severance in order to transplant.
                Germination from seed to flowering plant requires 10-16 years. In the Great Lakes Region,
                late hard frosts will cut down most scapes, but affect the leaves themselves very little;
                consequently, few plants bloom in such a year. Following a frost-free blooming season,
                hundreds of seed pods ripen in the larger colonies.
                Pollinated by bumble bee (Bombus) queens (Stoutamire, 1967, 1969).

            <h4>Specific Habitat</h4>
            <p>
                Two different types of habitat: one dry to moist, the other moist to wet. The first is
                provided by maturing coniferous forests in areas of thin soil or sand dunes over flat-lying
                calcareous rocks. Plants grow in dappled to partial shade of openings in the forest canopy.
                Moist to wet conditions of coniferous fens and edges of cedar swamps sometimes drown plants
                in rising water levels.
            </p>
            <h4>Flowering Season</h4>
            <p>Last 10 days of May to mid. June.</p>
            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                Height 10-50 cm. Stem slender and hairy.
                Leaves 3-4, deep green, elliptical, strongly ribbed, arranged in a rough spiral about the
                stem.
                Flowers solitary, scape to 15 cm. Petals and sepals greenish-brown, linear. Lip is white
                crisscrossed with dark red veins, sometimes veins are faint. Lip is prolonged downward into
                a small conical pouch. Mouth of lip covered with white hairs . Opening circular.
            </p>
            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Blooms a little ahead of other Cypripediums in areas where it occurs. Most common on Bruce
                Peninsula and Manitoulin Island in Ontario. Some locations in the Bruce Peninsula and Ottawa
                District are known to have provided stable habitats for this genus for many decades. Plants
                develop rapidly after appearing above ground, and blossom is rather short-lived. Pollination
                of a bloom creates a hormone reaction within an hour, causing the upper sepal to drop down
                and seal the lip. Requires cool soil conditions.

                Marly soil of fens. Shade intolerant. Decreasing due to invasion of their open habitat by
                woody shrubs. In southern Ontario, now only located on the delta islands of Lake St. Clair
                in open wet prairies, and at Stoco Fen in Hastings County, located in marshy openings.
                Now extinct from near Bothwell in Kent County (Saunders, 1926), near Crystal Beach in
                Welland County (J. A. Simon and G. J. Yaki, pers. Comm,), near Port Elgin in Bruce County

            <h4>Comments</h4>
            <p>
                Undoubtably the rarest of the ladyÕs-slippers in Ontario. It has declined throughout most of
                its range, becoming rare as a result of drainage of wetlands and conversion of prairies to
                agricultural land.
                It has been found that annual mowing effectively increased a population of Cypripedium
                candidum (Curtis, 1946), illustrating how simple management can help maintain a rare
